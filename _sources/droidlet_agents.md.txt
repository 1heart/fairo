# batteries included droidlet agents
We instantiate a droidlet [agent](https://github.com/fairinternal/minecraft/blob/master/locobot/agent) on a [Locobot](http://www.locobot.org/) and an [agent](https://github.com/fairinternal/minecraft/blob/master/craftassist/agent) in Minecraft using the [Craftassist](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08584) framework (the droidlet project evolved from Craftassist).

### Locobot PyRobot interface ###



## Craftassist ##
Details for setting up and running the Cuberite server and Craftassist agent are [here](https://github.com/fairinternal/minecraft/blob/master/craftassist/README.md)

The craftassist perception modules are mostly heuristic.  A model for semantic segmentation is [here](https://github.com/fairinternal/minecraft/tree/master/craftassist/agent/voxel_models/detection-transformer/)
